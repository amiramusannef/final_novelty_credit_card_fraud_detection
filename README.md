# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Explainable ANN
Goal: Optimizing fraud detection while making the predictions of the model more understandable and transparent by visualizing which features influence their decisions.

# General Acknowledgement
This model was developed based on a Kaggle notebook titled “Credit Card Fraud Detection using ML models” by Shalinee Kumari (https://github.com/Shalinee13/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML-models?tab=readme-ov-file), which provided data understanding, EDA, model building and model evaluation.

Modifications: Implementation of Hybrid Sampling Technique and ANN model building including custom dropout, batch normalization, and callback tuning.
